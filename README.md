The carbon neutrality of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) cargo proceeds from an amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) compensated by carbon credits certified by an organization deriving from CO2 reduction projects, such as reforestation.

We offer new capabilities to tackle issues actors are dealing with by generating transparent, traceable, accountable, secure data management for LNG buyers and sellers, responsible sourcing, and green LNG products. LNG has a Premium if it is monitored (transparency), transferred (frictionless), priced/valued (fair), integrated (externals), and verified (trustworthiness). Secure, accountable, and trustworthy monitoring are keys to reinforcing energy efficiency management actions on the sustainability of LNG itself by verifying the source of provenance (LNG cargo) and offsets.

Users will transact carbon-neutral LNG in a secure & private exchange with a verified identity information, strengthened by distributed semantic energy data management and energy data science.

Our solution triggers positive social and environmental impacts to sustain green energy, provide innovative business models, address civil society expectations, and fulfill industrial gas consumers' needs at the EU level and beyond.
